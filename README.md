# MoneyLens UI

MoneyLens UI is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing personal finances. The interface emphasizes clarity, responsiveness, and ease of navigation, enabling users to track expenses, visualize financial data, and interact with core features efficiently. Built with modern web technologies, MoneyLens UI aims to make financial management accessible and engaging for everyone.


The MoneyLens UI leverages React for building dynamic user interfaces, Refine for rapid development of data-driven applications, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. This combination ensures a robust, scalable, and visually appealing frontend architecture, enabling efficient development and a consistent user experience across devices.

This [Refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine) project was generated with [create refine-app](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/create-refine-app).

## Getting Started

A React Framework for building internal tools, admin panels, dashboards & B2B apps with unmatched flexibility ✨

Refine's hooks and components simplifies the development process and eliminates the repetitive tasks by providing industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of a project, including authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n.

## Available Scripts

### Running the development server.

```bash
    npm run dev
```

### Building for production.

```bash
    npm run build
```

### Running the production server.

```bash
    npm run start
```

## Deployment (Vercel)

This project is deployed on Vercel with two environments:

- Pre-production (Vercel Preview): all branches except `release` deploy here automatically.
- Production (Vercel Production): the `release` branch deploys here automatically.


No GitHub Actions are required for deploys; Vercel will build and deploy automatically on pushes/PRs according to the branch rules above.

### Branch → Environment mapping

- `release` → Production deployment
- any other branch (including `main`) → Preview deployment (preproduction)


## Development workflow

Short-lived branches are created off `main`, changes are merged via PR, and deploys happen automatically:

1) Start work

- Branch from `main`: `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, or `chore/*`.
- Push commits and open a PR into `main`.

2) CI & review

- PR builds a Vercel Preview automatically (preproduction URL).
- Reviewers verify changes using the Preview URL and approve the PR.

3) Merge to `main`

- After merge, the `main` branch continues to deploy to the preproduction (Preview) environment.

4) Promote to production via `release`

- When a releasable set of features is ready, open a PR from `main` → `release`.
- Merging into `release` automatically deploys to the Production environment on Vercel.

### Hotfixes (optional)

- For urgent production fixes, create `hotfix/*` from `release`, open a PR into `release` (deploys to Production on merge), then synchronize those changes back to `main` (PR `release` → `main` or re-merge the hotfix).

### Best practices

- Prefer squash merges into `main` to keep history clean.
- Keep `release` fast-forward or synced from `main` via PRs to avoid drift.

## Operating notes

- Preview URLs are unique per commit/PR—share them in code reviews and QA.
- Environment variables in Vercel are injected at build time; update and redeploy if they change.
